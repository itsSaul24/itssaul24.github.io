I graduated with a Data Science degree from Purdue University and I&apos;m currently pursuing my Master&apos;s in Computer Science at Georgia Tech.

I&apos;m passionate about solving data challenges across the full stack. When I&apos;m not working through code (or fixing my own bugs), you can find me running around NYC or hanging out with family and friends.
